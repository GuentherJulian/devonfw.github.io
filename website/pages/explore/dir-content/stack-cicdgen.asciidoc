cicdgen is a devonfw tool for generate all code/files related to CICD. It will include/modify into your project all files that the project needs run a Jenkins cicd pipeline, to create a docker image based on your project, etc. Itâ€™s based on angular schematics, so you can add it as a dependency into your project and generate the code using ng generate. In addition, it has its own CLI for those projects that are not angular based.
