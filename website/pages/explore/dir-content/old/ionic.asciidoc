== Ionic/Capacitor

Ionic is a front-end focused framework which offers different tools for developing hybrid mobile applications. The web technologies used for this purpose are CSS, Sass, HTML5 and Typescript.

Why Ionic?

Ionic is used for developing hybrid applications, which means not having to rely on a specifyc IDE such as Android Studio or Xcode. Furthermore, development of native apps require learning different languages (Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for Apple), with Ionic, a developer does not have to code the same functionality for multiple platforms, just use the adecuate libraries and components.
